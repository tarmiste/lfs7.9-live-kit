Welcome to LFS live.   

LFS live is a self contained build environment that can be booted from a 
CDROM or USB flash device and provide the tools needed to build an
LFS or CLFS system.

IMPORTANT! Building LFS (or CLFS) requires the user to partition, format, and
peform other operations that could be damaging to existing data on the
system.  Attempting to build LFS on a system that contains useful
data could potentially cause loss of that useful data.   It is prudent 
that you either build LFS on a 'burner' system (a system which 
contains no useful data) or first make backup copies of every useful
piece of data on the system before starting the LFS/CLFS build
process.

This image consists of a LFS 7.9 base build plus a number of additional 
packages and scripts that are useful in contstructing an LFS/CLFS system.
This image includes:

1) The tools described in "Host System Requirements" in the LFS 7.9 book.
2) The tools described in "Host System Requirements" in the CLFS 3.0.0 book.
3) The tools needed to run the jhalfs tool.
4) The tools needed to add the blfs_tool to your LFS installation.
5) Tools needed for connecting to the internet.
6) Copies of the LFS 7.9 book, the BLFS 7.9 book, and the jhalfs tool.
7) The tools needed to download copies of the LFS, CLFS and other packages.
8) A (text based) web browser and cut and paste support via mouse.

This image does *NOT* include a copy of the source needed to build LFS or
CLFS.   The needed source packages can be downloaded from the internet once
internet connection is established or could be provided by the user via 
a USB flash drive or other local media.

The '/collateral' folder in this image contains copies of the LFS book and other
information that may be useful to the user.


Configuring logins:

The 'builder' login is intended to be used for the LFS build.  The 
default builder user password is 'builder'.  To add builder to the sudoers
list, as root, run visudo and add builder to the sudoer list.  Note: To run
jhalfs, the builder login must have sudo permissions.

The root login requires no password.   The root login is used for
administrative purposes but is not used for building LFS.


Using the lynx browser:

This live image provides a text mode browser (lynx).  Lynx can be
started by running the command 'lynx'.  As a companion tool, the
'GPM' mouse daemon is also provided and it allows the user to 
cut and paste using the mouse buttons.  

Lynx's default home page has been set to the local '/collateral' 
directory.   The /collateral directory contains local copies of the
LFS and BLFS book in html format.   And so, the LFS and BLFS books
are available for viewing with lynx even without a network connection.

Once, network connection is established, lynx can be used to browse
the internet in text mode.

Note that the /collateral directory contains local copies of the LFS
and BLFS books but does not contain copies of the CLFS book.  When 
building CLFS, the CLFS book must be obtained via the network or
otherwise be provided by the user.



Establishing a network connection:

By default the network interfaces are not enabled at startup.   The user
must configure networking (if networking is desired).

It is not an absolute requirement that networking be enabled.  If a local 
copy of the needed source packages is available, the user can build a LFS
or CLFS system without a network connection.  In this case , the user
can skip configuration of the network altogether.

However, in most cases, a network connection is either needed for 
download of source packages or is simply desired for ease of use.  And so,
most users will need to configure a network connection.

This image provides tools for connecting to wired, wireless and serial 
(dial up) network connections.   Establishing a wired connection is 
the best option as it is the easiest to get working.   Wireless connections
often require external firmware (i.e. not part of this live image), 
passwords and such and so wireless connections are often difficult to get
working.

For Wired connection:

Section 7.5 of LFS7.9 may provide additional material that is useful
for establishing a network connection....

To establish a wired connection, the user must (usually) modify the 
ifconfig.eth0 script in /etc/sysconfig and then 'ifup' the interface.

First run the 'ifconfig -a' command and make note of which wired 
connections are present in the output.   If the output shows 'eth0' as
the wired connections, then simply execute the command 'ifup eth0' and
after a few seconds, the network connection should be up.  e.g. do:

ifup eth0

If the wired connection is not named 'eth0' (and it usually won't be),
then the user must rename /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 file to end
with the wired connection name and also modify the contents of the file
to replace 'eth0' with the wired connection name.   As an example, if
'ifconfig -a' shows that 'enp0s7' is the name of the wired connection
then do:

cd /etc/sysconfig
mv ifconfig.eth0 ifconfig.enp0s7
vi ifconfig.enp0s7
:1,$s/eth0/enp0s7/
:w
:q

The connection will be configured with dhcp.   If static IP is desired,
the ifconfig.xxx file may be modified to obtain a static IP instead.

The wired connection can be confirmed by pinging:

ping 8.8.8.8
ping ftp.kernel.org

Note: The live image sets /etc/resolv.conf to point to the Google name server
(8.8.8.8).   This should work for most situations.  However if
a different nameserver is needed or desired, then modify /etc/resolv.conf
as needed.


For Wireless connection:

This live image provides the wireless-tools and wpa-supplicant tool
to help establish a wireless connection.   The user may find the 
'wpa-supplicant' section of the BLFS book to be useful in establishing
a wireless connection.

Establishing a wireless connection often requires the user to provide 
external firmware that is needed by the wireless driver.  This live image
contains all the firmware that is available in the kernel source package
but no firmware other than the kernel provided.   If external firmware
is required, then it must be obtained and added to the /lib/firmware
directory in this live image.

This live image defaults to a wireless name of 'wifi0'.  The actual name
of the wireless interface on the system will likely be different than 
'wifi0'.   Determine the name of the wireless interface on the system
by doing:

'ifconfig -a' and finding the name of the wireless interface in the output.
Several configration files must be modified to reflect the actual
name of the wireless interface.

To establish a wireless connection, provide the wireless network
name and password.   e.g.:

wpa_passphrase SSID SECRET_PASSWORD > /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf

(Remember to use the actual name of the wireless interface instead of 'wifi0')

To establish a wired connection, the user must (usually) modify the 
ifconfig.wifi0 script in /etc/sysconfig and then 'ifup' the interface.

First run the 'ifconfig -a' command and make note of which wired 
connections are present in the output.   If the output shows 'wifi0' as
the wired connections, then simply execute the command 'ifup wifi0' and
after a few seconds, the network connection should be up.  e.g. do:

ifup wifi0

If the wired connection is not named 'wifi0' (and it usually won't be),
then the user must rename /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.wifi0 file to end
with the wired connection name and also modify the contents of the file
to replace 'wifi0' with the wired connection name.   As an example, if
'ifconfig -a' shows that 'mlan0' is the name of the wired connection
then do:

cd /etc/sysconfig
mv ifconfig.wifi0 ifconfig.mlan0
vi ifconfig.mlan0
:1,$s/wifi0/mlan0/
:w
:q

The wireless connection can be confirmed by pinging:

ping 8.8.8.8
ping ftp.kernel.org


For Dialup connection:

This live image provides pppd.  XXX This needs work.


Remote login:

This live image includes a sshd server.  This allows the user
to login to the LFS live system from a remote machine.  The remote
machine may have browsers and other tools that make the LFS build
easier to perform remotely than it otherwise would be from a local
console on the LFS live system.

Once a network connection is established, from the remote machine, do:

ssh IPADDRESSOFLIVE -l builder

Note: it is not possible to ssh into the live system as 'root' user.



Using jhalfs:

This live image provides a local copy of the jhalfs tool (in /collateral).
jhalfs is a tool which automates much of the building of LFS/BLFS and CLFS.

The local copy of jhalfs is a snapshot of the jhalfs code as it existed
at the time of the LFS 7.9 release.   It will function properly for
building the LFS 7.9 release but may not work for building releases 
other than LFS 7.9.   If a more recent copy of jhalfs is required by
the user, then it may be downloaded as follows:

svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/ALFS/jhalfs/trunk jhalfs

If the local copy of jhalfs is acceptable, then simply extract it 
from the tarball in /collateral.

Run jhalfs by doing:

cd jhalfs
make clean
make

Configure your desired build options and let it run.

jhalfs requires a copy of the LFS book.  Normally, jhalfs will download
the LFS book.  However when building on a system with no internet connection,
a local copy of the book (and all the LFS source packages) must be 
provides by the user.   A local copy of the LFS 7.9 book (in xml format) can
be found in /collateral.   To use the local copy of the LFS book, 
unpack it and then point jhalfs to it by selecting it as the 'working copy'

This live image provides the tools needed by the 'blfs_tools' option
in jhalfs.   blfs_tools provides for semiautomated build of BLFS 
packages in the completed LFS system.   However, the blfs_tool 
selection will cause the BLFS book be downloaded and so requires
a network connection to function properly.


Injecting the live image to hard drive:

Normally, the live image will be run from the live media and not become
part of the local hard drive.  However, if desired, it can be injected 
into a hard drive partition and then be booted from hard disk intead of
the live media.  If installing the live image onto hard drive is 
desired, boot up the live image and do:

1) Identify a free hard drive partition and format it.   
2) mount the free partition at a mount point (/mnt/hd for example).
3) cd /mnt/.boot/system
4) find . -print |cpio -pdvum /mnt/hd 
5) vi /mnt/hd/etc/fstab and modify mount point for the selected partition.
6) Modify your system bootloader config files as needed to boot
   the kernel found in /mnt/hd/boot and the selected partition.

Then reboot and select the proper boot option to startup the live
image installed on hard disk.

Running the live image from hard drive allows the user configurations
(network and such) to be retained through reboot and also frees up the 
CD drive for other uses during the LFS build.
